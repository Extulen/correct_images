# Correct Images
This repository has been created to provide tools for applying physics based correction to images and associated coco formatted labels. Scale correction requires a csv file listing image names and the altitude/distance from subject matter within each photo. Distortion correction requires a camera information file that gives the camera distortion matrix.
